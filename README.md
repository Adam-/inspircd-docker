# InspIRCd

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Adam-/inspircd-docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Adam-/inspircd-docker)

InspIRCd is a modular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server written in C++ for Linux, BSD, Windows and Mac OS X systems which was created from scratch to be stable, modern and lightweight.

InspIRCd is one of only a few IRC servers to provide a tunable number of features through the use of an advanced but well documented module system. By keeping core functionality to a minimum we hope to increase the stability, security and speed of InspIRCd while also making it customisable to the needs of many different users.

# Bootstrapping

The easiest way to run this image is using our bootstrap script.

To use it run the following statement:

```console
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adam-/inspircd-docker/master/bootstrap.sh | sh
```

The bootstrap script takes care about the fact that docker is installed and runs the image.

If port `6697` or `6667` are already in use another random port is used. Otherwise those ports are allocated by the container.

# How to use this image

First, a simple run command:

```console
$ docker run --name ircd -p 6667:6667 inspircd/inspircd-docker
```

This will start an InspIRCd instance listening on the default IRC port 6667 on the container.

To include your configuration into the container use:

```console
$ docker run --name inspircd -p 6667:6667 -v /path/to/your/config:/inspircd/conf/ inspircd/inspircd-docker
```

*Notice: In case you provide an empty directory make sure it's owned by UID 10000. Use `chown 10000 directory` to correct permissions*

Default ports of this container image:

|Port|Configuration     |
|----|------------------|
|6667|clients, plaintext|
|6697|clients, TLS      |
|7000|server, plaintext |
|7001|server, TLS       |


## TLS

### Using self-generated certificates

This container image generates a self-signed TLS certificate on start-up as long as none exists. To use this container with TLS enabled:

```console
$ docker run --name inspircd -p 6667:6667 -p 6697:6697 inspircd/inspircd-docker
```

You can customize the self-signed TLS certificate using the following environment variables:

* `INSP_TLS_CN`
* `INSP_TLS_MAIL`
* `INSP_TLS_UNIT`
* `INSP_TLS_ORG`
* `INSP_TLS_LOC`
* `INSP_TLS_STATE`
* `INSP_TLS_COUNTRY`
* `INSP_TLS_DURATION`

### Using secrets

We provide the ability to use `secrets` with this image to place a certificate to your nodes.

**Docker version 1.13 is required and [secrets are only supported in swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/)**

```console
docker secret create irc.key /path/to/your/ircd.key
docker secret create inspircd.crt /path/to/your/ircd.crt

docker service create --name inspircd --secret source=irc.key,target=inspircd.key,mode=0400 --secret inspircd.crt inspircd/inspircd-docker
```

Notice the syntax `--secret source=irc.key,target=inspircd.key` allows you to name a secret in a way you like.

Currently used secrets:

* `inspircd.key`
* `inspircd.crt`


# Build extras

To build extra modules you can use the `--build-arg` statement.

Available build arguments:

|Argument|Description                                              |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
|VERSION |Version of InspIRCd. Uses `-b`-parameter from `git clone`|
|CONFIGUREARGS|Additional Parameters. Used to enable core extras like `m_geoip.cpp`|
|EXTRASMODULES|Additional Modules from [inspircd-extras](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd-extras/tree/master/2.0) repository like `m_geoipban`|
|ADDPACKAGES|Additional packages which are installed before compilation|
|DELPACKAGES|Additional packages which are deleted after compilation|

```console
docker build --build-arg "ADDPACKAGES=geoip geoip-dev pcre-dev pcre" --build-arg "CONFIGUREARGS=--enable-extras=m_geoip.cpp --enable-extras=m_regex_pcre.cpp"  --build-arg "EXTRASMODULES=m_geoipban" inspircd-docker
```

## Building additional modules

In case you want to develop InspIRCd modules it is useful to run InspIRCd with modules which neither exist in core modules nor in extras.

You can put the sources these modules in the modules directory of this repository. They are automatically copied to the modules directory of InspIRCd.

It also allows you to overwrite modules.

Make sure you install all needed dependencies using `ADDPACKAGES`.
